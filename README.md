# rom_prepare
This is another small tool for SMD or other ROM preparations. It can pad a ROM file to a certain size in megabits. It can pad ROMs to a certain byte size, can swap bits, so you can use the file directly in an EPROM burner. There is another function which lets you do a full rom preparation.
The program can also use an input file, just use it with a zero as a starting argument, and the next one will be the file you wan to process.
The code is far from best, but it serves it's purpose. It was written a long time ago, and I'm still learning the language.
